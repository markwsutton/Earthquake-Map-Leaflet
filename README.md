# Live Earthquake Map

Real-time visualization of live earthquake GeoJSON data from USGS utilizing Leaflet/Javascript. The data is updated every 5 minutes. 

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. Pop-up info is retreived from the GeoJSON data and is revealed upon clicking the circles.
